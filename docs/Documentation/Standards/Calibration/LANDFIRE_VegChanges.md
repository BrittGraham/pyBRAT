MATT - REPLACE BODY HERE with what you decide to say from: https://github.com/Riverscapes/pyBRAT/issues/221

Namely, we should make sure that if we are making coding changes to LANDFIRE EVT we should also be considering making the same changes to the BPS layer when and where this is appropriate. We want to avoid what we had in the uplands of the Brunt River watershed BPS veg scores that were lower than EVT.
