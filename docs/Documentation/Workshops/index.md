title: BRAT Workshops

We have taught a variety of BRAT workshops <i class="fa fa-users"></i> for specific projects. We have not tended to teach any publicly offered BRAT workshops as the 'user-community' of folks actually running the models has remained pretty small. Instead, the 'end-users' tend to be stakeholders, practitioners and policy-makers interested in using BRAT to scope, plan and prioritize for using beaver as a restoration and conservation tool in their watersheds. We find that BRAT is a more effective tool when these end-users are brought to the table, they gain a working understanding of what's behind BRAT, and their inputs, concerns, values and management priorities are used to update the maps that make up BRAT. This is critical not just for understanding, but for local ownership.
