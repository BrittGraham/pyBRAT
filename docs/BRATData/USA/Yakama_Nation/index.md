## Executive Summary ##

This report presents an application of the Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool [2.0.0](https://github.com/Riverscapes/pyBRAT/releases/tag/v2.0.0) (BRAT; [http://brat.riverscapes.xyz/),](http://brat.riverscapes.xyz/),%20) a decision support and planning tool for beaver management (Macfarlane etal. 2017). In this application we analyzed all the perennial rivers and streams within the Yakama Nation Reservation, which includes portions of the Lower Yakima, and Klickitat watersheds (8-digit USGS Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC 8)). As part of Contract Modification 1, we expanded our analysis to include Rock Creek watershed (10-digit USGS Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC10)), which is presented in the body of this report. As part of Contract Modification 2 we again expanded our analysis and included the White Salmon,Little White Salmon and Wind River watersheds (HUC 10’s) which is presented in the Appendix A because this modification was awarded after this report was drafted.

 

The backbone to BRAT is a capacity model developed to assess the upper limits of riverscapes ability to support beaver dam-building activities. Both existing and historic capacity were estimated using readily available spatial datasets to evaluate five key lines of evidence: 1) a perennial water source, 2) availability of dam building materials, 3) ability to build a dam at baseflow, 4) likelihood of dams to withstand a typical flood, and 5) likelihood that stream gradient would limit or completely eliminate dam building by beaver. Fuzzy inference systems were used to combine these lines of evidence while accounting for uncertainty.

 

The estimated existing Yakama Nation Reservation-widecapacity is 30,688 dams or roughly 10 dams/km. By contrast, the same modeldriven with estimates of historic vegetation types estimated the Yakama NationReservation-wide capacity is 40,760 dams or roughly 13 dams/km reflecting a 25% loss compared to historiccapacity. Nearly all of this capacity loss can be explained in terms ofvegetation loss and degradation associated with land use including: i)urbanization in the Yakama valley, ii) conversion of valley bottoms to agriculturalland uses, iii) overgrazing in upland areas, iv) conifer encroachment of wetmeadow areas. Despite the losses, the uniform ownership of the reservation and goodcondition of many streams in the reservation means Yakama Nation’s waterwaysare still capable of supporting and sustaining a substantial amount of beaverdam-building activity. By contrast, the estimated existing beaver dam capacityoutside the Yakama Nation Reservation but within the Lower Yakima, Klickitatand Rock Creek watershed is 14,507 dams or roughly 5 dams/km and historic estimatesis 28,080 dams or roughly 10 dams/km reflecting a 48% loss compared to historiccapacity.

 

The capacity modelestimated existing capacity for Lower Yakima, Klickitat and Rock Creekwatersheds combined at 45,195 beaver dams (8 dams/km) and the historic capacityat 68,840 dams (12 dams/km), reflecting a 35% loss compared to historiccapacity. At the individual watershed level beaver dam capacity was found to beas follows. Lower Yakima, 18,753 beaver dams (7 dams/km) and the historiccapacity at 35,593 dams (14 dams/km). Klickitat 24,945 beaver dams (8 dams/km)and the historic capacity at 31,328 dams (10 dams/km) and Rock Creek 1,497beaver dams (11 dams/km) and the historic capacity at 1,920 dams (14 dams/km).

 

We verified theperformance of the existing capacity model using 122 existing dams throughout thefull extent representing 0.4% of the 5996 kilometers of perennial streams. Wefound that model performance was spatially coherent and logical, withelectivity indices that effectively segregated out amongst the capacitycategories. That is, only one beaver dam was found where the model predicted nodams could be supported, beaver exhibited avoidance of reaches predicted assupporting rare or occasional densities, and beaver exhibited preference forareas predicted as having pervasive dam densities. Of the total 93 streamsegments with validation dam counts 15 exceeded the capacity estimatesindicating that the model effectively segregates the factors controlling beaverdam occurrence and density 84% of the time.

 

The decision supportand planning tool side of BRAT uses simple geospatial analysis and rule systemsto account for human conflict potential with beaver dam building and therecovery potential of riparian habitat to segregate the stream network intovarious conservation and restoration zones. BRAT categorized 52% of the reservationas ‘Low-hanging Fruit’ streams signifying habitats that are either currentlyinhabited by beaver or are in relatively good condition for beaverre-colonization and/or reintroduction. 

 

The model wouldbenefit from additional actual dam count data based on field reconnaissancedata especially in more remote portions of the reservation. These data could beused to further validate the model and could also be used to identify sourceand sink zones throughout the reservation. Accurate identification of sourceand sink zones will help Yakama Nation biologists continue to manage beaverpopulations, especially nuisance beaver. 

 

The spatially explicitoutputs from this application of BRAT provides Yakama Nation biologists withthe information needed to effectively identify where nuisance beaver can berelocated, where ‘Living with Beaver’ strategies may be needed and where beavercan be used for watershed restoration efforts to have the greatest potential toyield increases in biodiversity and ecosystem services. Not only does this informationhelp with broad-scale planning efforts, but the resolution is sufficient tosupport detailed design and on the ground implementation of translocation andrestoration activities.
