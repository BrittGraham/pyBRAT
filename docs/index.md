## About

<div class="float-right"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/Beaver_EcosystemEngineer.png"/></div>Welcome to the pyBRAT website. The Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool (BRAT) is a decision support and planning tool intended to help researchers, restoration practitioners and resource managers assess the potential for beaver as a stream conservation and restoration agent over large regions and watersheds. 

The BRAT model can be run with freely available national data sets (or with higher resolution data). , and is used to identify opportunities,  potential conflicts and constraints through a mix of assessment of existing resources and scenario-based assessment of potential futures. The backbone to BRAT are **spatial models that predict the capacity of riverscapes to support dam-building activity by beaver**. 


By combining capacity and decision support approaches, researchers and resource managers have the information necessary to determine where and at what level reintroduction of beaver and/or conservation is appropriate. 

For more information on beaver and workshops we occasionally teach, see [here](http://beaver.joewheaton.org/).
